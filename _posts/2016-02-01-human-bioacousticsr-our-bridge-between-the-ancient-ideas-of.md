# Human BioAcoustics(r) Our bridge between the ancient ideas of sound healing and the futuristic Star Trek. 

Scientifically, Sound Health has proven that people with similar diseases, toxicities,
syndromes, traumas...have similar, if not identical, vocal anomalies; and that information
can be used to support optimal form and function.
As a bridge between in ancient ideas of sound healing and the futuristic, Star Trek,
protocols that the institute provides, it is now possible to reverse diseases and traumas
previously thought to be incurable, to reveal the secrets of our true nature, to enhance
our lives, to predict what may be our fate through the frequencies of our voice. 

Everything that happens to the body reaches the brain as biofrequencies that are then
sorted, routed and assigned an interpretation but it seems, in modern times, that we
carry very little conscious awareness of this information. Did we as a human race forget,
or were we politically forced to abandon, a great deal of our intrinsic abilities that allow
us to glean information about another person simply by hearing their voice?

**Knowing your own voice takes on new meaning if you begin to consider the possibility
that the sounds of your voice may be a holographic representation of all that you are, all
that you can be.**

Imagine a future in which our individual vocal frequencies represent
our identification; where the use of frequency based biomarkers contained within our
voice can be used to keep us healthy and emotionally balanced.
From birth to death, we use sounds to express our needs and emotions but there are
additional layers of information hidden within our words. As man evolved, language
became levels of intricate harmony nestled within structures of great elegance that carried
meaning and allowed understanding of ourselves and others
The Institute of BioAcoustic Biology & Sound Health has taught us that **nothing is hidden
from your own voice. **You may be able to lie to your friends and deceive yourself with
your words but the vocal frequencies do not lie. Vocal Profiling computer software can
evaluate the frequencies, architectures and harmonics of your voice. Vast frequency
based databanks can now be used to create a report of what you really think, who you
are emotionally and the status of your health and wellness. The frequencies missing from
your voice are just as important as those that are present. An entire matrix of
information, from your DNA to your partner preferences can be evaluated.
Sound Health has proven that your voice can be used to reveal who you really are under
the layer of public personality you have created. This is an opportunity for the human
race to break free of all of the deceit and deception that we live with on a daily basis.
Vocal Profiling has the ability to let us know: the intentions of our leaders, the
motivations of our partners; the pathway to our sense of self; how to facilitate space
travel without injury, the formulas to annihilate superbugs; how we can easily heal and
become whole. Could finding our true voice allow us to create a world full of grace and
dignity? How would that change the world?
