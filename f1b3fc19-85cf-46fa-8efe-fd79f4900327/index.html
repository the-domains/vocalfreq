Biology is an emerging science capable of providing biometric information
through a mathematically-based evaluation of anomalous vocal acoustics.</p><p>Published reports indicate that vocal
analysis has been used to determine levels of hormones and biological reactions
during drug trials.</p><p>Stephen Williams,
Pfizer’s executive Director of Clinical Technology, states that Pfizer has been
able to detect otherwise invisible efficacy reaction biomarkers using voice
spectral analysis.</p><p>Defining disease and staging biometrics is
still novel but “diagnostic biomarker” is not yet a defined biomarker category
(Boguslavsky, 2004).</p><p>In fact most
biometric information is being used only in clinical trial selection and
evaluation with the exception of the exploration being done at the Sound Health
Research Institute in Ohio.</p><p>Their
investigative work, spread over the last three decades, includes evaluations of
biochemical cascades, structural configurations, nutritional assessments, heart
and eye disease templates and genetic make-up plus toxicity and pathogenic
exposure information.</p><p>The Institute, in
addition to the Acoustical Society of America, has taken a leading role in
defining this field.</p><p>Vocal pattern assessment incorporates
mathematical analysis of anomalous vocal acoustics, coupled with the evaluation
of amplitude decay among low-order harmonics.</p><p>The results are being used in an attempt to model the frequencies and
architecture of coherent acoustic parameters contained within the human
voice.</p><p>This emerging system of
articulation of sample analysis is being uniquely investigated for its
potential to develop reliable frequency-based protocols that can define innate,
mathematically derived templates of human biology and definitive disease with
health biomarkers.</p><p>Embracing the idea that <b>t</b><b>he voice is a
biometric representation of health and wellness, through the recurrent
laryngeal and direct vagus nerve associations with the brain, Vocal Assessment
has the potential to provide significant bioinformation.</b></p><p>BioAcoustic Biology research has established
and is testing predictive biometric templates for nutritional needs, heart and
eye health through biomarkers gained from acoustic vocal samples. Additional
research includes anti-aging potential, Alzheimer’s biomarkers, Fibromyalgia,
autism and stroke recovery. </p><p>The brain communicates using the language of
frequency that can be expressed mathematically.</p><p>The brain receives and assigns signals to ranges and areas of the brain
for interpretation and possible reactions. Events experienced by the body reach
the brain as biofrequencies that are then sorted, routed and assigned an
interpretation designation.</p><p>The brain
uses a network of frequencies to communicate internally.</p><p>When we speak, the vibrations of the vocal
cords create resonances that reverberate throughout the body.</p><p>These resonant frequencies have an
entrainment influence on the brain and nervous system.</p><p>Like music, the voice is a measurable
arrangement of sounds.</p><p>The voice as
spoken language is a complex, often mathematically discordant, cacophony of
sounds.</p><p>Each word contains individual
sound units called phonemes.</p><p>Vocal
analysis mathematically examines the chaos, the dissonance, of these
phonemes.</p><p>Language barriers do not play
a part in this type of evaluation.</p><p>Any
sound, including moaning, crying, laughing or nonsense syllables may be used to
reveal biometric information.</p><p>The foundational principle on which
BioAcoustic Biology has been established is the concept that the voice is a
comprehensive representation of the body that can be mapped through uniquely
devised algorithms to provide a glimpse into the individual biological,
chemical, and structural make-up of the body.</p><p>Through distinguishing mathematical
calculations, termed in the field of Human BioAcoustics, as “Mathways”, (as in
Pathways when referring to chemical cascades of reference), BioAcoustic Biology
related studies have shown considerable promise in allowing science to observe
the interconnected systems of the body; not merely as closed systems working
independently, but as actual frequency-based structural as well as biochemical
interactions of the body.</p><p>As an example, a recent evaluation of a
pregnant volunteer showed that hormones responsible for labor and delivery could
be monitored by studying the changes in vocal acoustics during pre-labor and
the labor initiating process.</p><p>The
Frequency Equivalent (FE) of a labor inducing medication, Pitocin, is indicated
in Chart 1 using a frequency domain vocal print; and reported in terms of time
intervals in Chart 2.</p><p>Most labor and delivery hormones can be
monitored in the same way.</p><p>This
technique would allow a quick assessment to discriminate between false and
actual labor thereby saving considerable resources for insurance companies,
medical personnel and clinical resources.</p><p>Like chemistry, which draws conclusions
using elements and compounds, BioAcoustic Biology uses sound to explain our
frequency-based biological systems.</p><p>Vocal Profiling, Human BioAcoustics and BioAcoustic Sound Presentation
are clinical aspects under the master heading of “Sonistry”, which is being
defined as the study and application of sound and sound frequencies as a
universal measurement of biologically related events.</p><p>The opportunity to create precedent-setting
protocols has the potential to significantly expand understanding of the human
body as a collection of predictable math-base compilations.</p><p>The need for advanced biometric diagnostic
templates is apparent in light of Secretary Michael Leavitt’s (Health &
Human Services) commitment to “transform the healthcare system”.</p><p>Among his plans is the initiative that
wellness and prevention should be sought as rigorously as treatment, and that
health care should be available and affordable.</p><p>Routine vocal assessment could be used to
monitor medications; the overall health of a person with limited mobility;
suspected toxin or pathogenic exposures; and the status of persons in remote
locations.</p><p>Sites such as airports,
airplanes, land based transit systems, buildings or other geographically
sensitive locations could be monitored.</p><p>Since the vocal samples are digital in format, they can be sent and
received via satellite or the internet to a central location with no loss of
integrity.</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>Chart-1</b></p><p>
Frequency Domain Vocal Sample - The circle indicated by the arrow represents
the Frequency Equivalent(FE) of Pitocin.</p><p>In the example monitoring Pitocin during induced labor, the FE of
Pitocin began to ascend beyond the coherence range of the vocal architecture as
the dosage increased.</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>Chart-2</b></p><p> –
Time table key of Pitocin FE vocal acoustic evaluations for an induced labor
due to previous C-section; labor was induced nine days prior to the due
date.</p><p>Charts 3 and 4 represent Frequency Equivalent
(FE) levels of Pitocin and a CONTROL comparison.</p><p>It was expected that the Frequency
Equivalent (FE-Q) of the drug would increase as the dosage increased. Such was
the case.</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>Chart-3</b></p><p> - </p><p>During childbirth the labor inducing drug, Pitocin, was monitored as the
dosage was increased. </p><p>It was expected
that the Frequency Equivalent (FE-Q) of the drug would increase as the dosage
increased. Such was the case.</p><p>0 =
highest frequency</p><p>During
the observation sequence additional hormone FE’s were sampled and could likely
have been used to predict the emergency (3:30am) C-section that was the end
result of this induced labor.</p><p>As early as 10:30am, the vocal print
indicated that the body was producing biochemicals known to act as blocking
agents to the onset of labor contractions.</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>Chart-4</b></p><p> - </p><p>During childbirth/labor, a
CONTROL frequency was used for comparison with the labor inducing drug,
Pitocin.</p><p>As
expected the CONTROL showed erratic frequency fluctuations.</p><p>Vocal Profiling is an innovative methodology
that has the potential to answer the demand for efficient, non-invasive and
mobile methods of monitoring health status.</p><p>A review of blood analysis laboratories
indicated that it can take as long as two weeks to return an evaluation of
nutritional status.</p><p>On-line Vocal
Profiling would make the assessment nearly instantaneously.</p><p>The system once funded and in place, could
provide the ability to evaluate health in a timely and cost-effective manner,
making it possible that inequities in our present health system could be
abated.</p><p>The theoretical basis of such use of sound
has progressed to the stage that preliminary technical definitions can be
advanced</p><p>The therapeutic potential of using the
evaluation of anomalous vocal acoustics for the identification of
pre-diagnostic biometrics could enhance or render inert, disease-based
biomarkers depending on the desired outcome.<br><b></b></p><p>The results promise to add significant confirmation to the idea that our
bodies constitute a predictable system of mathematical computations.</p><p>Vocal algorithms give us an unprecedented
window into individual BioAcoustic Biology.</p><p>To further advance the field of Human BioAcoustics, based on the
clinical and research experiences of the Institute, the author proposes the
following draft definition for consideration by the Acoustical Society of
America:</p><p>“Human BioAcoustic vocal
pattern assessment incorporates the mathematical analysis of anomalous vocal
acoustics, coupled with the evaluation of amplitude decay among low-order harmonics.</p><p>The results may be used to preliminarily
model the frequencies and architecture of coherent acoustic bioinformation
contained within the human voice.</p><p>This
emerging system of Vocal Profiling has the potential to develop reliable
frequency-based protocols that can define intrinsic, mathematically derived
templates of human biology and definitive disease and health biomarkers.”</p></div></article></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="47"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="48"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="49"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="50"><span data-reactid="51"><!-- react-empty: 52 --><h2 data-reactid="53"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="54">Computerized biometric frequency
