MedicineÂ by Sharry Edwards, MEdÂ </h2><p><i>Â Studies conducted by the non-profit Institute of BioAcoustic Biology, located in Albany, Ohio,  USA, has shown that persons with similar stresses, toxins, diseases, traumas, genetic  syndromes, deficienciesâ¦have similar, if not identical, vocal anomalies showing that math can  be much more than a measurement tool. Math, as a frequency matrix, can serve as the  template to perceive and manage health and wellness.</i></p><p>Â In order to provide predictability and safety, the concepts of math and medicine often act conjointly to quantify, define and model medical practice. Defined as Bioinformatics1 , this industry has become an integral part of medical care. The Journal
    of BioAcoustic Biology (<a href="http://www.JBAB.org/">http://www.JBAB.org</a>) reports the studies conducted by the non-profit Institute of BioAcoustic Biology, located in Albany, Ohio, USA, which have consistently demonstrated that math can be much
    more than a measurement tool; math, as frequency, can be the resolution to therapeutic predictability, management and resolution.Â </p><p>Â Consider the brain as the central processing unit of the body. Brain messages (as frequency impulses) use a neural network distributed throughout the body to organize, interpret and maintain equilibrium (homeostasis). Everything that is perceived by
    the body reaches the brain (from various sensory organs) as a biofrequency that is then sorted, routed and assigned an interpretation and designation.Â </p><p>Â Studies by the Institute of BioAcoustic Biology affirm the fact that persons who hold similar perceptions and psychologies; and those suffering from similar diseases, traumas, toxins, deficiencies, syndromesâ¦ have similar, if not identical, biofrequency
    patterns.Â </p><p><i>The Business of Disease: An Inside Job and Outside Business</i> edited by Sonia Barrett2 includes a chapter devoted to explaining the pathways of compounds called Chemistry; as they relate to Mathways of subtractive frequencies that can be used to
    create a numeric biomarker matrix capable, individually and collectively, of being predictive, diagnostic and prescriptive. The Making History by Creating the Future chapter speculates that resonate matrix-based medicine has the ability to provide
    prompt and corrective protocols.Â </p><p>Â To date there is no universally accepted modality that has the potential to assist in the survival of biological, radioactive and pandemic threats; reverse stroke and muscle trauma or support space travel as frequency based solutions show the ability
    to overcome bone-loss and muscle atrophy. The Washington Post (Sept 12, 2014)3 reports that in many instances, by the time the cause has been identified, it is often too late to provide remediation.Â </p><p>Â A previous project in conjunction with the US Army4 was undertaken to test this emerging technology by exploring the potential of using frequency based biomarkers to identify and quantify Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and associated Post Traumatic Stress
    Disorder (PTSD).</p><p>Â The implication of the prior study was the development of a quantitative, mobile, noninvasive model that could identify the damage caused by close proximity acoustic blast injuries and, ultimately, the restitution of normal brain function and emotional
    stability. The work being pioneered by the Institute continues to employ numeric biomarker patterns to assess, evaluate and produce outcomes that support optimal biological form and function.Â </p><p>Â Brian Butterworth, author of <i>What Counts: How Every Brain is Hardwired for Math5</i> states that our brain communicates using the language of math expressed as frequency. As these signals reach the brain, the biofrequencies are sorted, routed and
    assigned an interpretation and responsibility. Our brain and our biology are hardwired to respond to these basic principles of math.Â </p><p>Â This novel math-based protocol utilizes the premise that the body can identify and prescribe for itself using the algorithms of vocalized frequencies to accurately quantify, organize, and extrapolate biometric information. Experimental studies showing

    in a research mode as of the date of this writing.Â </p><p>Â Strange, yet profound, BioAcoustic Biology may someday explain how a physician might instruct a heart patient to âlisten to a specific frequency combination [known for its ability to stabilize heart rhythm] and call me in the morningâ.</p><p><b>References:</b> âThis novel protocol utilizes the premise that the body can identify and prescribe for itself using algorithms of vocalized frequencies to accurately quantify, organize, and extrapolate biometric information.â 1BioInformatics: Oxford

To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete" ~Buckminster FullerÂ </p></blockquote></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="147"><p>Imagine a future in which our individual vocal frequencies represent
our identification; where the use of frequency based biomarkers contained within our
voice can be used to keep us healthy and emotionally balanced.
From birth to death, we use sounds to express our needs and emotions but there are
additional layers of information hidden within our words. As man evolved, language
became levels of intricate harmony nestled within structures of great elegance that carried
meaning and allowed understanding of ourselves and others
The Institute of BioAcoustic Biology & Sound Health has taught us that <b>nothing is hidden
from your own voice. </b>You may be able to lie to your friends and deceive yourself with
your words but the vocal frequencies do not lie. Vocal Profiling computer software can
evaluate the frequencies, architectures and harmonics of your voice. Vast frequency
based databanks can now be used to create a report of what you really think, who you
are emotionally and the status of your health and wellness. The frequencies missing from
your voice are just as important as those that are present. An entire matrix of
information, from your DNA to your partner preferences can be evaluated.
Sound Health has proven that your voice can be used to reveal who you really are under
the layer of public personality you have created. This is an opportunity for the human
race to break free of all of the deceit and deception that we live with on a daily basis.
Vocal Profiling has the ability to let us know: the intentions of our leaders, the
motivations of our partners; the pathway to our sense of self; how to facilitate space
travel without injury, the formulas to annihilate superbugs; how we can easily heal and
become whole. Could finding our true voice allow us to create a world full of grace and
dignity? How would that change the world?
